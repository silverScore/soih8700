---------------------------------------------------------
One approach to bulk insert data into SQLite database used by Django is to use the built-in bulk_create method of the Django ORM.

Here's an example of how to use bulk_create:

from myapp.models import MyModel

data = [
    MyModel(field1='value1', field2='value2'),
    MyModel(field1='value3', field2='value4'),
    # ...
]

MyModel.objects.bulk_create(data)
Note that this method is more efficient than creating and saving instances of your model one at a time, because it performs the inserts in a single database query.
---------------------------------------------------------
Please tell me how to insert data from csv file.
You can insert data from a CSV file into a SQLite database used by Django using the following steps:

Read the data from the CSV file using the csv module in Python.
Loop over the rows of the CSV data, and for each row, create an instance of your Django model with the desired fields.
Use the bulk_create method to insert all of the instances into the database in one query.
Here's an example:

import csv
from myapp.models import MyModel

data = []
with open('data.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        data.append(MyModel(field1=row['field1'], field2=row['field2']))

MyModel.objects.bulk_create(data)
In this example, the DictReader class from the csv module is used to read the data from the CSV file into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the file. The desired fields from each row are then used to create an instance of the MyModel Django model.

장고에서 2개의 컬럼을 Foreign Key로 정의하는 방법이 있는지?
Is there a way to define 2 columns as Foreign Key in Django?

Yes, you can define two columns as foreign keys in Django by creating two separate fields in your model, each with its own ForeignKey relationship.

Here's an example:

from django.db import models

class OtherModel1(models.Model):
    # fields for OtherModel1

class OtherModel2(models.Model):
    # fields for OtherModel2

class MyModel(models.Model):
    field1 = models.ForeignKey(OtherModel1, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    field2 = models.ForeignKey(OtherModel2, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # other fields for MyModel
In this example, field1 and field2 are both foreign keys to other models, OtherModel1 and OtherModel2 respectively. When you use the ForeignKey field in Django, it creates a one-to-many relationship between the two models, where one instance of OtherModel1 or OtherModel2 can be related to multiple instances of MyModel, but each instance of MyModel is related to only one instance of OtherModel1 or OtherModel2.

---------------------------------------------------------
How should I define it when pairing two columns?
If you want to define a relationship between two columns in a Django model, you can create a many-to-many relationship using the ManyToManyField.

Here's an example:

from django.db import models

class OtherModel(models.Model):
    # fields for OtherModel

class MyModel(models.Model):
    field1 = models.ForeignKey(OtherModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='field1')
    field2 = models.ForeignKey(OtherModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='field2')
    # other fields for MyModel
In this example, field1 and field2 are both foreign keys to the same model, OtherModel. The related_name attribute is used to give each foreign key a unique name, which is necessary because each instance of OtherModel can have multiple related instances of MyModel.

If you want to allow a single OtherModel instance to be related to multiple instances of MyModel in both field1 and field2, you would need to use a ManyToManyField instead of a ForeignKey:
---------------------------------------------------------
class MyModel(models.Model):
    fields = models.ManyToManyField(OtherModel)
    # other fields for MyModel
This creates a many-to-many relationship between MyModel and OtherModel, allowing a single OtherModel instance to be related to multiple instances of MyModel, and vice versa.





장고에서 오라클의 number와 varchar 속성은 어떻게 정의하지?
In Django, you can define Oracle's NUMBER and VARCHAR fields using the following types from the django.db.models module:

For NUMBER:

models.IntegerField for integer values
models.FloatField for floating point values
models.DecimalField for decimal values with a fixed precision
For VARCHAR:

models.CharField for character strings with a fixed length
models.TextField for character strings with a variable length
Here's an example:

from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    number_field = models.IntegerField()
    varchar_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # other fields for MyModel
In this example, number_field is defined as an IntegerField, which can store integer values, and varchar_field is defined as a CharField with a maximum length of 100 characters, which can store character strings with a fixed length.

2개의 컬럼이 Primary Key인 경우에는 어떻게 정의하지?

How to define if two columns are primary key in Django ?
To define a composite primary key in Django, you can use the CompositeKey class from the django-compositepk package, or you can use the models.Model base class and override the Meta inner class to specify the primary key fields. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    field1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    field2 = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = [("field1", "field2")]
        index_together = [("field1", "field2")]
        verbose_name_plural = "MyModels"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.field1} - {self.field2}"

In this example, field1 and field2 together form a composite primary key for the MyModel class. The unique_together option in the Meta inner class ensures that the combination of values for field1 and field2 must be unique, making it a primary key.



f"{self.field1} - {self.field2}" what does it mean?
f"{self.field1} - {self.field2}" is a string formatting expression in Python using the f-string syntax, introduced in Python 3.6.

In this specific case, it returns a string that is the concatenation of the values of field1 and field2 separated by a dash (-). self.field1 and self.field2 are attributes of the MyModel instance being referred to as self.

The string returned by this expression is used to represent the instance in various places, such as the Django admin interface, or when calling str(instance).


---------------------------------------------------------
What can I use instead of dash (-)?
You can use any character, string, or combination of characters and strings you like in place of the dash (-) in the string formatting expression. For example, you could use a colon (:), a space, or a combination of a space and a comma:

python
Copy code
def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.field1}:{self.field2}"
python
Copy code
def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.field1} {self.field2}"
python
Copy code
def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.field1}, {self.field2}"
It's up to you to choose the format that best represents the instance of your model.
